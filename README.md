# PythonforSS

This is code and data for the student project "Python programming for social sciences" at the University of Mannheim.

Th .ipynnb file is the Jupyter Notebook containing the code. 
The .pickle files are backups from the fetched data from the twitter API. This saves you the hassle to extract the data yourself and it makes the results reproducable, even if you do not have your own twitter dev acount and the associated keys.
